# K&R C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and notes from **_The C
Programming Language_** by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (K&R).  

I’m using this repo to track my learning progress in C, one exercise at
a time.

## About
The goal is to:
- Practice writing idiomatic, clean C code  
- Learn the core concepts from K&R  
- Build confidence solving small, focused programming problems

## Progress
2025-09-15 Started  Chapter 1
2025-11-01 Finished Chapter 1.

## Completed Exercises

### Exercise 1-12

/* 
 * Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per
 * line. 
 */ 
[`ex.1-12`](ex.1-12.c)

### Exercise 1-13

/* 
 * Exercise 1.13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of
 * words in its input.  It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars
 * horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. 
 */
[`ex.1-13`](ex.1-13.c)

### Exercise 1-14 ###

/* 
 * Exercise 1-14.  Write a program to print a histogram of the
 * frequencies of different characters in its input. 
 */
[`ex.1-14`](ex.1-14.c)

### Exercise 1-15 ###

/* 
 * Exercise 1-15. Rewrite the tempreature conversion program of Section
 * 1.2 to use a function for conversion.
 */
[`ex.1-15`](ex.1-15.c)

### Exercise 1-16 ###                                     

/* 
 * Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so
 * it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines,
 * and as much as possible of the text.
 */
[`ex.1-16`](ex.1-16.c)

### Exercise 1-21 ### 

/* 
 * Exercise 1-21. Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks
 * by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing.
 * Use the same tab stops as for entab. When either a tab or a single
 * blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
 * preference? 
 */
[`ex.1-21.c`](ex.1-21.c)

## Notes

- Getting comfortable with character arrays and loops  
- Exploring how to process text input in C  
- Reinforcing how C handles whitespace and formatting
