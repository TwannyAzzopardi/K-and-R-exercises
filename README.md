# K&R C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and notes from **_The C Programming Language_** by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (K&R).  
I’m using this repo to track my learning progress in C, one exercise at a time.

## About
The goal is to:
- Practice writing idiomatic, clean C code  
- Learn the core concepts from K&R  
- Build confidence solving small, focused programming problems

## Completed Exercises

### Exercise 1-16 ###                                     
/* Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so it will
 * correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines, and as
 * much as possible of the text.*/
[`ex.1-16`](ex.1-16.c)

### Exercise 1-21 ### 
/* Exercise 1-21. Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks
 * by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing.
 * Use the same tab stops as for entab. When either a tab or a single
 * blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
 * preference? */
[`ex.1-21.c`](ex.1-21.c)

## Notes

- Getting comfortable with character arrays and loops  
- Exploring how to process text input in C  
- Reinforcing how C handles whitespace and formatting  

---

## How to Run

Compile and run any exercise manually:

```bash
gcc ex.1-21.c -o ex.1-21
./ex.1-21
