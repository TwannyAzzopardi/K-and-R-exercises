# K&R C Programming Exercises

This repository contains my solutions and notes from **_The C
Programming Language_** by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (K&R).  

I’m using this repo to track my learning progress in C, one exercise at
a time.

## About
The goal is to:
- Practice writing idiomatic, clean C code  
- Learn the core concepts from K&R  
- Build confidence solving small, focused programming problems

## Completed Exercises

### Exercise 1-03
/* 
 * Exercise 1-3. Modify the tempreature conversion program to
 * print a heading above the table.
 */

[`ex.1-03`](ex.1-03.c)
### Exercise 1-04
/* 
 * Exercise 1-4. Write a program to print the corresponding Celsius to
 * Fahrenheit table. F = ( 9/5 X C ) + 32 
 */

[`ex.1-04`](ex.1-04.c)
### Exercise 1-05
/* 
 * Exercise 1-5. Modify the temperature conversion program to print the
 * table in reverse order, that is from 300 degrees to 0. 
 */

[`ex.1-05`](ex.1-05.c)
### Exercise 1-06
/* 
 * Exercise 1-6. Verify that the expression getchar() != EOF is 0 or 1.
 */

[`ex.1-06`](ex.1-06.c)
### Exercise 1-07
/* Exercise 1-7. Write a program to print the value of EOF. */

[`ex.1-07`](ex.1-07.c)
### Exercise 1-08
/* 
 * Exercise 1-8. Write a program to count blanks, tabs, and newlines.
 */

[`ex.1-08`](ex.1-08.c)
### Exercise 1-09
/* 
 * Exercise 1-9.  Write a program to copy its input to its output,
 * replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.  
 */

[`ex.1-09`](ex.1-09.c)
### Exercise 1-10
/* 
 * Exercise 1-10. Write a program to copy its input to its output,
 * replacing each tab by \t, each backspace by \b, and each backslash by
 * \\. This make tabs and backspaces visible in an unambiguous way. 
 */

[`ex.1-10`](ex.1-10.c)
### Exercise 1-12
/* 
 * Exercise 1-12. Write a program that prints its input one word per
 * line. 
 */

[`ex.1-12`](ex.1-12.c)
### Exercise 1-13
/* 
 * Exercise 1.13. Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of
 * words in its input.  It is easy to draw the histogram with the bars
 * horizontal; a vertical orientation is more challenging. 
 */

[`ex.1-13`](ex.1-13.c)
### Exercise 1-14 ###
/* 
 * Exercise 1-14.  Write a program to print a histogram of the
 * frequencies of different characters in its input. 
 */

[`ex.1-14`](ex.1-14.c)
### Exercise 1-15 ###
/* 
 * Exercise 1-15. Rewrite the tempreature conversion program of Section
 * 1.2 to use a function for conversion.
 */

[`ex.1-15`](ex.1-15.c)
### Exercise 1-16 ###                                     
/* 
 * Exercise 1-16. Revise the main routine of the longest-line program so
 * it will correctly print the length of arbitrarily long input lines,
 * and as much as possible of the text.
 */

[`ex.1-16`](ex.1-16.c)
### Exercise 1-17 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-17. Write a program to print all input lines that are
 * longer than 80 characters. 
 */

[`ex.1-17`](ex.1-17.c)
### Exercise 1-18 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-18 : Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs
 * from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines. 
 */  

[`ex.1-18`](ex.1-18.c)
### Exercise 1-19 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-19. Write a function reverse(s) that reverses the
 * character string s. Use it to write a program that reverses its input
 * a line at a time. 
 */

[`ex.1-19`](ex.1-19.c)
### Exercise 1-20 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-20. Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input
 * with the proper number of blanks to space to the next tab stop.
 * Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a
 * variable or a symbolic parameter? 
 */

[`ex.1-20`](ex.1-16.c)
### Exercise 1-21 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-21. Write a program entab that replaces strings of blanks
 * by the minimum number of tabs and blanks to achieve the same spacing.
 * Use the same tab stops as for entab. When either a tab or a single
 * blank would suffice to reach a tab stop, which should be given
 * preference? 
 */

[`ex.1-21`](ex.1-21.c)
### Exercise 1-22 ### 
/* 
 * Exercise 1-22. Write a program to "fold" long input lines into two or
 * more shorter lines after the last non-blank character that occurs
 * before the n-th column of input. Make sure your program does
 * something intelligent with very long lines, and if there are no
 * blanks or tabs before the specified column 
 */

- Getting comfortable with character arrays and loops  
- Exploring how to process text input in C  
- Reinforcing how C handles whitespace and formatting
